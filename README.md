# General Idea
This app is designed to automate the process of downloading anime from the internet.

It uses some built-in libraries like os, threading, time, tkinter and collections->deque.

It also uses other libraries like cloudscraper and bs4, they are included in the ```requiremnets.txt``` file.

# Installation

Just run ```install.bat```
# How to run

run using the exe file in the releases or using ```run.bat```

# Other Notes

This app only supports anime3rb.com links like ```https://anime3rb.com/titles/naruto```.

The app will store the downloaded episodes in a folder named output in the same folder as ```main.py``` or the executable.

# Enjoy ^^
